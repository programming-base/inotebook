## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18.x or higher is recommended)
-   `npm` (comes with Node.js)
-   MongoDB installed and running locally or a connection string to a cloud instance.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/inotebook.git
    cd inotebook
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend**
    ```sh
    cd backend  # Or your backend folder name
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. See the Environment Variables section below for the required keys.
    ```sh
    npm run dev # Start the backend server
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend**
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev # Start the frontend development server
    ```
    Your application should now be running. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite/Create React App).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

The backend relies on a `.env` file for configuration. Create one in the root of your backend directory and add the following variables:

```env
# Server Port
PORT=3000

# MongoDB Connection URI
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/inotebook

# JWT Secret for signing tokens
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

# Google OAuth Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# GitHub OAuth Credentials
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

## üöß To-Do & Future Improvements

This project is a work in progress. Key areas for future development include:

-   [ ] **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Remove hardcoded user IDs and JWTs in `PrivateNotes.jsx` and `SecureNotes.jsx`. All data should be fetched based on the authenticated user's context.
-   [ ] **Implement Full CRUD**: Wire up the UI buttons to fully implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for all note types.
-   [ ] **Complete Login/Signup Form**: Implement the backend logic for the manual email/password login and signup form.
-   [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement global error handling and display user-friendly feedback for API failures.
-   [ ] **Note Security Feature**: Develop the "Secure Note" feature, potentially with client-side or end-to-end encryption.
-   [ ] **Add Tests**: Write unit and integration tests for both the frontend components and backend API endpoints.
